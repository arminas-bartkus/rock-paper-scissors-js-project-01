# rock-paper-scissors-js-project-01

Here is my first Javascript Project! This is
initially a console based game of rock paper
scissors. When run the computer will choose, 
either, rock, paper, or scissors. The user
will then be prompted to select one. The 
outputs will be compared. Then, using, the well
known rules of the game, a winner will be
annouced. The game will then be restarted.

This should test my use of developing
pseudocode, functions, and logic. As well as
this, I will likely be participating in my
first set of error handling using the 
google dev tools.
