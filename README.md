# rock-paper-scissors-js-project-01

**THIS PROJECT IS ODIN PROJECT TRAINING
EXERCISE**

Here is my first Javascript Project! This is
initially a console based game of rock paper
scissors. When run the computer will choose, 
either, rock, paper, or scissors. The user
will then be prompted to select one. The 
outputs will be compared. Then, using, the well
known rules of the game, a winner will be
annouced. The game will then be restarted.

This should test my use of developing
pseudocode, functions, and logic. As well as
this, I will likely be participating in my
first set of error handling using the 
google dev tools.

This project is now complete, currently,
there are no GUI elements to it. The
program is comprised of 3 functions and 
a for loop. 

The functions: 
- Create a random choice for the computer
- prompts the user for an input
- Calculates the winner, displaying a
message every round, and keeps track
of player and computer points

The for loop:
- Iterates 5 times running through 
each function in each cycle.

At the end a message a displayed,
with the winners score and identifer!

This project has now been updated. The repo now
contains user interface elements so that 
buttons can be pressed to select the human
option. A reset button was added 
to reset the game.Instead of the results 
logging to the console. They now are displayed
 on screen. Some basic CSS styling was also 
 added. Please note that this website does not 
 work as intended on all display types. Notably
mobile devices. This is because I have not 
covered these concepts in my learning 
yet. Desktop should work fine though!
